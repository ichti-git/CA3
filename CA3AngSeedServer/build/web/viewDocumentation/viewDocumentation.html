<h3>Test strategy</h3>
<h4>Backend</h4>
UserFacadeTest.java<br>
For the UserFacade I tested:
<ul>
    <li>Getting user by username</li>
    <li>Creating a new user</li>
    <li>Trying to create a new user, with an already existing username</li>
    <li>Deleting an user by username</li>
    <li>Trying to delete by a non-existing username</li>
    <li>Authenticating correctly and with wrong id and name</li>
</ul>
All the above tests passed.<br>
<br>
CurrencyFacadeTest.java<br>
For the CurrencyFacade I tested (or wanted to test):
<ul>
    <li>Adding a new currency</li>
    <li>Getting the latest exchange rate by currency, happy path (not implemented)</li>
    <li>Getting the latest exchange rate by a currency that doesn't exist</li>
    <li>Adding a new exchange rate</li>
    <li>Adding a new exchange rate where the currency doesn't exist yet</li>
    <li>Getting the latest (cached) exchange rates (not implemented)</li>
    <li>Updating the cached exchange rates (not implemented)</li>
    <li>Authenticating correctly and with wrong id and name</li>
</ul>
All the above tests passed.

<h4>REST API</h4>
RESTTest.java<br>
I didn't get to implement the tests of the REST API, except a few. 
I outlined (in the RESTTest.java file) what I wanted to test. 
Here's the outline:<br>
    /* Test company search (user test):<br>
        search (everything)<br>
        vat (cvr)<br>
        name<br>
        produ (production unit)<br>
        phone<br>
        404 (just one?)<br>
    */<br>
    <br>
    /* Admin test:<br>
        get user list<br>
            - happy path<br>
            - maybe 404?<br>
        delete user<br>
            - happy path<br>
            - 404<br>
    */<br>
    <br>
    /* Currency test:<br>
        get daily rates<br>
            - happy path<br>
            - maybe 404?<br>
        exchange calculator<br>
            - happy path?<br>
            - wrong amount<br>
            - wrong from/to<br>
            - 404<br>
    */<br>
    <br>
    /* Create new user test<br>
        - New user<br>
        - Already existing user<br>
    */<br>
    
<br>
<h4>Frontend</h4>
/Unit Tests<br>
I tested the 4 controllers of the views: viewAllUsers, viewNewUser, 
viewCompanyInfo, viewExchangeRate.<br>
All Users: Testing that the users fetched is being assigned to the variable correctly.<br>
All Users: Testing that the user being deleted is correctly removed from the array.<br>
New User: Testing that variables usersignup and usersignupmsg is being assigned correctly.<br>
Company Info: Testing that the function calls the correct URL, and then 
the variables companydata and companydataavailable is being assigned correctly.<br>
Exchange Rates: Testing that runExchange() calls the currect URL and that it assigns the result to 
the variable calcResult. This test was made to test the function where it calls the API, 
so it fails because it no longer uses the API.<br> 
Exchange Rates: Testing that the currencies is being swapped correctly when calling swapCurrencies().
<br>
All the test except the runExchange() one should pass in test.

<br>
<h3>How to test the system</h3>
There is 3 default users you can use to test the system. <br>
They all use the password "test". The users and roles:<br>
user - only User role.<br>
admin - only Admin role.<br>
all - both Admin and User role.<br>
<br>
If they do not work or you deleted them, you can recreate them by going to 
<a href="api/make">api/make</a>. This will create those 3 users if they do not exist,
and it does not require authentication.

<br>
<h3>General</h3>
<a href="http://ca-ichti.rhcloud.com/CA3AngSeedServer">Openshift</a><br>
<a href="">Github</a><br>
This project was done alone.<br>
<br>
Right now you can only get the most recent exchange rate through the REST API.
It would make sense if you could choose the date instead and also have a call to get all 
(or maybe limited to some amount) the exchange rates in one call.<br>
I didn't implement fail function in most of the angular function. That should of course 
also be included.<br>
I didn't know how to handle the case where you try to create a user with existing username.
I ended up just sending a message about it back, with status code 200. It should probably have been
some other status code (404?).
